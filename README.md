## 🌟 Welcome to My Little Corner of the Digital Era! 🌟
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m an aspiring software developer and a Computer Science major who is on a mission to turn coffee into code ☕💻. 
When I’m not buried in coursework, I’m exploring endless possibilities and building cool stuff. 
Right now, I’m diving deep into backend development — APIs, databases, and all the magic that happens behind the scenes.
